His amazon, apple and gmail account were used to gain access to his twitter profile, which was then used to broadcast hateful messages. And if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, his iPhone, iPad, and macbook were all wiped to prevent him from regaining access to his accounts. Unfortunately, Honan did not keep backups of his macbook and lost all his photos and videos of his daughters first few years.</p><p>Firstly, the hacker was able to find his email address on his personal website which was linked to on his twitter profile. Then from the google account recovery website he was able to find out that Honan&rsquo;s recovery email was a me.com email provided by Apple. The hacker then got Honan&rsquo;s billing address using a whois request on his personal website, then manipulated amazons customer service to obtain the last four digits of one of Honan&rsquo;s credit cards. He then used the billing address and the credit card to convince Apple&rsquo;s customer service team that he was Honan - despite being unable to answer the security questions - and take over his Apple account. The hacker then wiped Honan&rsquo;s devices then used his email accounts to gain access to his Twitter.</p><p>When Honan discovered that he had been hacked, he called apple customer service, which achieved very little. He then made a post on his Tumblr account detailing what had happened to him. Subsequently, the hackers reached out to him and told him how and why they had hacked him. Ultimately the hacks main purpose was to gain access to his twitter account which was valuable because he had a short username. They just wanted to ""</p><ul><li>guy got hacked</li><li>amazon - apple - gmail - twitter</li><li>could have been prevented with 2fa on google</li><li>ultimate goal twitter</li><li>should have used backups for devices</li><li>was his fault</li><li>but also security flaws in apple and amazon<ul><li>final four digits shared by amazon are required by apple</li><li>disconnect exposes flaws in tech industry</li><li>foreshadows issues in era of cloud and connected devices</li><li>password based systems are no longer suffice</li></ul></li></ul><p>5pm</p><ul><li><p>phone powered down</p></li><li><p>This was irritating, but I wasn’t concerned</p></li><li><p>assumed it was a software glitch</p></li><li><p>phone automatically backs up</p></li><li><p>I was irritated, but not alarmed.</p></li><li><p>the screen went gray, and asked for a four-digit PIN</p></li><li><p>I knew something was very, very wrong.</p></li><li><p>unplugged my router and cable modem, turned off the Mac Mini</p></li><li><p>called AppleCare</p></li><li><p>a call had been placed just a little more than a half an hour before my own.</p></li><li><p>Apple rep didn&rsquo;t bother to tell me about the first call concerning my account</p></li><li><p>only shared this information after I asked about it</p></li><li><p>someone called AppleCare claiming to be me.</p><ul><li>reported that he couldn&rsquo;t get into his Me.com e-mail</li><li>issued a temporary password</li><li>despite the caller’s inability to answer security questions I had set up</li><li>it did this after the hacker supplied only two pieces of information that anyone with an internet connection and a phone can discover.</li></ul></li><li><p>a password reset confirmation arrived in my inbox</p><ul><li>I don’t really use my me.com e-mail, and rarely check i</li><li>hackers immediately sent it to the trash.</li><li>reset my AppleID password</li></ul></li><li><p>Gmail password recovery e-mail</p><ul><li>Google account password had changed</li></ul></li><li><p>reset my Twitter password.</p></li><li><p>used iCloud’s “Find My” tool to remotely wipe my iPhone, iPad, Macbook</p></li><li><p>deleted my Google account</p></li><li><p>the attackers posted a message to my account on Twitter taking credit for the hack.</p></li><li><p>not only had the ability to control my account, but were able to prevent me from regaining access</p></li><li><p>those deletions were just collateral damage</p></li><li><p>I spent an hour and a half talking to AppleCare</p><ul><li>Apple had been looking at the wrong account</li><li>alternate set of questions</li><li>a billing address and the last four digits of my credit card.</li></ul></li><li><p>all you need to access someone’s AppleID is the associated e-mail address, a credit card number, the billing address, and the last four digits of a credit card on file.</p></li><li><p>company spokesperson Natalie Kerris told Wired, &ldquo;Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password. In this particular case, the customer&rsquo;s data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer. In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely. We are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers&rsquo; data is protected.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Wired tried to verify the hackers&rsquo; access technique by performing it on a different account.

They should have systems in place to detect attacks when they happen, and have a plan for how to respond, and prevent it from occuring again in the future. If they are unable to respond to attacks themselves, they should know who to contact. They should also purchase a cyber security insurance policy, and consider what legal obligations they have to their stakeholders.</p><a href=#strong-user-authentication><h3 id=strong-user-authentication><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Strong User Authentication</h3></a><p>This one of the most important rules. In addition to strong passwords SMEs should require two-factor authentication, preferrably with an authenticator not just by text.</p><p>SMEs should also require users to create strong security questions, so that accounts can be recovered if a password is stolen, there should not be any secondary questions that a user can use to recover an account.</p><a href=#awareness-training><h3 id=awareness-training><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Awareness Training</h3></a><p>For all employees including customer service and tech support. Employees should be made aware of the proper procedures and standards and adhere strictly to them.</p><a href=#backups><h3 id=backups><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Backups</h3></a><p>In the event of an attack, the company needs to have their data backed up. Backups should be done regularly. Backups should be made not only the main company and user data but also of all employees laptops and mobile devices.</p><p>Backups for different devices should be done at varying intervals - the more sensitive or important the data, the more frequent the backup.</p><p>Backups should be stored in a secure place in encrypted form. They should be stored offsite either via a cloud service or external physical locations.</p><a href=#perimeter-defenses><h3 id=perimeter-defenses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perimeter defenses</h3></a><p>use firewalls to protect against online threats.

User&rsquo;s should have only the minimal permission required to do their task. Higher level accounts like administrators should have further restrictions preventing them from doing user-level activities</p><p>Shared and shared-use accounts should be minimized. Unused accounts should be deleted.</p><a href=#references><h1 id=references><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>References</h1></a><ul><li><a href=https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CIS-Controls-Guide-for-SMEs.pdf rel=noopener>https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CIS-Controls-Guide-for-SMEs.pdf</a></li><li><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7587183?hl=en" rel=noopener>https://support.google.com/a/answer/7587183?hl=en</a></li><li><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9211704?hl=en" rel=noopener>https://support.google.com/a/answer/9211704?hl=en</a></li><li><a href=https://gblogs.cisco.com/ca/2019/11/08/baseline-cybersecurity-controls-for-small-and-medium-organizations/ rel=noopener>https://gblogs.cisco.com/ca/2019/11/08/baseline-cybersecurity-controls-for-small-and-medium-organizations/</a></li><li><a href=https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list rel=noopener>https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list</a></li><li><a href=https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/baseline-cyber-security-controls-small-and-medium-organizations rel=noopener>https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/baseline-cyber-security-controls-small-and-medium-organizations</a></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/notes/notes/comp-210/ data-ctx="assingment 3" data-src=/notes/comp-210 class=internal-link>comp-210</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://jethughes.github.io/notes/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made with <a href=https://obsidian.md>Obsidian</a> using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, 2022</p><ul><li><a href=/notes/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jethughes>Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jet-hughes-b3b688237>LinkedIn</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
